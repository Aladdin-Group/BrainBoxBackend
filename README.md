# 🧠 Brain Box Backend Welcome to the **Brain Box Backend** repository! This backend powers the Brain Box mobile application, which helps users learn English through an engaging and interactive experience using movie subtitles. The backend is modularized, developed in **Java**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**, and is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment. ## 📚 Table of Contents - [Project Overview](#project-overview) - [Architecture](#architecture) - [Modules](#modules) - [Getting Started](#getting-started) - [Usage](#usage) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [License](#license) - [Contact](#contact) ## 🌟 Project Overview **Brain Box** is an innovative platform designed to make learning English enjoyable and effective. By leveraging movie subtitles, users can improve vocabulary, comprehension, and pronunciation in a fun and engaging way. The backend is designed to handle data processing, user interactions, and subtitle management, ensuring a smooth and scalable experience. ## 🏗️ Architecture The backend is divided into several key modules, each developed in the most suitable language for the task: - **Java**: Core logic, subtitle processing, and user management. - **Python**: Vocabulary tools, pronunciation analysis, and natural language processing. - **JavaScript**: Interactive exercise creation and real-time user feedback. All modules are containerized with **Docker** for easy orchestration and scaling. ## 🔑 Modules - **🎬 Subtitle Processing (Java)** - Handles subtitle parsing, processing, and storage. - Provides APIs to retrieve subtitles based on user preferences. - **📚 Vocabulary Management (Python)** - Manages vocabulary lists and learning tools. - Tracks learning progress using spaced repetition algorithms. - **🎮 Interactive Exercises (JavaScript)** - Generates interactive exercises like fill-in-the-blank and multiple-choice questions. - Includes pronunciation practice using real movie dialogue. - **📊 User Progress and Personalization (Java)** - Tracks user progress and provides personalized learning paths. - Manages secure user data, authentication, and authorization. - **🗣️ Pronunciation Practice (Python)** - Compares user pronunciation with movie dialogue. - Provides feedback using machine learning models. ## 🚀 Getting Started ### Prerequisites Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. ### Clone the repository ```bash git clone https://github.com/omonovabdulaziz/BrainxBox.git docker-compose build docker-compose up -d
